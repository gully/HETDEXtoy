HETDEXtoy
=========

Toy model of what HETDEX will see for non-cosmology science
Started as part of #AstroHackWeek

Main goals:
==========
1. Science with non-cosmology astronomical sources
2. Inference on atmosphere based on sky signal
3. Inference on instrument based on sky signal



Science with non-cosmology sources
---------------------

Strategy
1. Back-of-the-envelope calculations of number density for naive Celestial Sphere model
2. Back-of-the-envelope calculations of number density for realistic Luminosity Function and distance distribution
3. Retrieval of desired quantities of interest at the low S/N ratio limit


Sensitivity issues:
+ Absolute (gray) flux of spectral targets
+ Typical spectrum of average target
+ Average spectral response of VIRUS

Number of spectra:
+ Total number of unique sky positions
+ Unique sky positions as a function of observing year

Probability of hitting a source that was in:
+ SDSS
+ SDSS Stripe 82



Inference on atmosphere based on sky signal
--------------------

How does cadence compare to typical HETDEX cadence?
+ Power spectrum of atmospheric variability
+ Typical HETDEX cadence

Atmospheric spectral diagnostics in wavelength range of interest
+ Average properties
+ Dependence on atmospheric conditions
+ Typical seasonal atmospheric variation

Spatial variation of Atmosphere
+ Attributable to real atmospheric physics


Inference on instrument based on sky signal
-------------------------------------------

Apparent variation of sky lines
+ Attributable to instrument
