HETDEXtoy
=========

Toy model of what HETDEX will see for non-cosmology science
Started as part of #AstroHackWeek

Main goals:
==========
1) Science with non-cosmology sources
2) Inference on instrument based on sky signal
3) Inference on atmosphere based on sky signal


Astronomical sources
---------------------

# Strategy
1) Back-of-the-envelope calculations of number density for naive Celestial Sphere model
2) Back-of-the-envelope calculations of number density for realistic Luminosity Function and distance distribution
3) Retrieval of desired quantities of interest at the low S/N ratio limit

Sensitivity issues:
+ Absolute (gray) flux of spectral targets
+ Typical spectrum of average target
+ Average spectral response of VIRUS

Number of spectra:
+ Total number of unique sky positions
+ Unique sky positions as a function of observing year

Probability of hitting a source that was in:
+ SDSS
+ SDSS Stripe 82


Sky signals
--------------------

How does cadence compare to typical HETDEX cadence-
+ Power spectrum of atmospheric variability
+ Typical HETDEX cadence

Atmospheric spectral diagnostics in wavelength range of interest
+ Average properties
+ Dependence on atmospheric conditions
+ Typical seasonal atmospheric variation

Spatial variation of Atmosphere
